## NamedExecutors DynamicPool
Named executors helps to monitor threads state, tasks latency and throughput.  
All pools can be dynamically reconfigured  
```kotlin

@PropertyId("dao.thread.pool.size")
lateinit var daoPoolSize: DynamicProperty<Integer>
lateinit var profiler: Profiler
...

val executor = NamedExecutors.newDynamicPool(
                "dao-pool",
                daoPoolSize,
                profiler)
```

## NamedExecutors Scheduler
Scheduler is based on `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` but it can change it's rate dynamically.
```kotlin

@PropertyId("work.rate")
lateinit var rate: DynamicProperty<Long>
@PropertyId("pool.size")
lateinit var poolSize: DynamicProperty<Int>

lateinit var profiler: Profiler
...

val scheduler = NamedExecutors.newScheduler(
        "regular-work-pool",
        poolSize,
        profiler)         
        
scheduler.schedule(
        Schedule.withRate(rate),
        0,//delay
        Runnable {
            //do work here
        })        
               
```

## NamedExecutors metrics
Common metrics that will work out of the box:

* `pool.<poolName>.queue` - size of pending tasks submitted to pool
* `pool.<poolName>.activeThreads` - count of currently running threads
* `pool.<poolName>.await` - how many ms spent task in pending state before pool took task for execution
* `pool.<poolName>.run` - how many ms task executed
* `pool.<poolName>.poolSize` - current size of the pool


Special case is Common Fork Join Pool that uses different set of metrics:
```kotlin
lateinit var profiler: Profiler
...
//Enable Common Fork Join Pool profiling
NamedExecutors.profileCommonPool(profiler)
```

* `pool.commonPool.poolSize` - current size of the pool
* `pool.commonPool.activeThread` - count of threads in the pool
* `pool.commonPool.runningThread` - count of currently active not blocking threads
* `pool.commonPool.queue` - size of pending tasks submitted to pool
* `pool.commonPool.steal` - count of stolen tasks

## ThreadPoolGuard
CommonThreadPoolGuard, ThreadPoolGuard allows you to watch for queue size of the thread pool. 
If it outgrows threshold guard will invoke user handler and print stack trace of all threads.

```kotlin
val guard = CommonThreadPoolGuard(
                profiler,
                checkRate,
                threshold) { queueSize, dump ->
            log.error("Queue size $queueSize is too big. Current threads state: $dump")
        }
```
 

# jfix-stdlib-ratelimiter

[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/ru.fix/jfix-stdlib-ratelimiter.svg)](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22ru.fix%22)

Provides RateLimiter and RateLimitedDispatcher.

## RateLimiter

`RateLimiter` interface is defined here as abstraction for `RateLimitedDispatcher`. 
You can wrap whatever rate limiter implementation you want into it.

Out of the box there is one implementation - `ConfigurableRateLimiter`. Under the hood it uses `AtomicRateLimiter` 
of [resilience4j-ratelimiter](https://github.com/resilience4j/resilience4j) preconfigured it to acquire limits smoothly. 
AtomicRateLimiter does not distribute events inside refresh period, it releases all available permits immediately on 
interval start if there is a demand for them. To distribute event in our interval of 1 second `ConfigurableRateLimiter` 
divides it into chunks so that 1 chunk of time is limited to 1 permit.The drawback is that actual rate will be lower 
than configured - depending on requests' distribution. 

## RateLimitedDispatcher

Enables async usage of rate limiter. Submitted tasks are executed in the order of submission.

Provides following metrics:

* `RateLimiterDispatcher.<dispatcherName>.queue_size` – incoming tasks queue size
* `RateLimiterDispatcher.<dispatcherName>.queue_wait` – task's wait time in the queue before execution
* `RateLimiterDispatcher.<dispatcherName>.acquire_limit` - time to acquire limit
* `RateLimiterDispatcher.<dispatcherName>.supplied_operation` - supplied task execution duration

# jfix-stdlib-socket

Provides SocketChecker.

## SocketChecker

Allows to check port availability by its port number. Allows to get random free port number in range from 30000 to 60000.

## JMH
Hot to run jmh tests for id generator: 
```
cd jfix-stdlib-id-generator-jmh
gradle --stop
gradle --no-daemon clean build jmh
```

# jfix-stdlib-batching

Encapsulates batching execution of several client's operations as one task.

```kotlin
//TODO provide example
```
