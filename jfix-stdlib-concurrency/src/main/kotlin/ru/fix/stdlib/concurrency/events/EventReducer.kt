/**
 * EventReducer invokes given [handler] when [handleEvent] function was invoked with passing event through given [reduceFunction].
 * All events passed through [handleEvent] function before [handler] complete his invocation
 * will be accumulated in single butch of events by given [reduceFunction]. When [handler] completed his invocation,
 * it will immediately invoked again with that butch of events. And so on.
 *
 * Therefore if [handleEvent] function was invoked 100 times with breaks in 1 millisecond,
 * and [handler]'s work takes 70 milliseconds,
 * then [handler] wasn't invoked 100 times, but 3 times, consistently.
 *
 * Here is example:
 * ```
 *  val events = Array(500) { it } //numbers from 1 to 500
 *  EventReducer<Int, MutableList<Int>>(
 *      profiler = NoopProfiler(),
 *      reduceFunction = { accumulator, event ->
 *          accumulator?.apply { add(event!!) } ?: mutableListOf(event!!) //accumulate ints in list
 *      },
 *      handler = {
 *          println(it!!.size) //print received list size
 *      }
 *  ).use {
 *      it.start()
 *      for (event in events) {
 *          it.handleEvent(event) //send 500 events
 *      }
 *      Thread.sleep(3_000) //block thread to see what will be send to console
 *  }
 * ```
 * It will produce something like that: `1 382 13 15 17 27 45`.
 * Given handler was invoked about 7 times instead of 500, and all 500 numbers reached by [handler]
