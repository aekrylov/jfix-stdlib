 * All events passed through [publishEvent] will be merged by [reduceFunction] into single accumulator.
 * When [extractAccumulatedValue] invoked, it will extract value from accumulator.
 *
 * If producers publishes events [publishEvent] with rate 1 per millisecond
 * and consumer invokes [extractAccumulatedValue] every second
 * then each 1000 events will be aggregated by [reduceFunction]
 * and consumer will see new aggregated value with rate 1 per second.
 *
 * ```
 * val events = Array(500) { it } //numbers from 1 to 500
 * val accumulator = ReducingEventAccumulator<Int, MutableList<Int>>(
 *   reduceFunction = { accumulator, event ->
 *     accumulator?.apply { add(event) } ?: mutableListOf(event) //accumulate ints in list

 * accumulator.close()
 * consumer.shutdown()

 * It will produce something like this: `1 93 91 91 93 92 39`.
